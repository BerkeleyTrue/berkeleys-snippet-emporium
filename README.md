vim-react-snippets
==================

A direct port of the snippets from 
[jgebhardt/sublime-react](https://github.com/jgebhardt/sublime-react)
to work with Vim.

Requires [vim-snipmate](https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate).

Installation
============

Just use your preferred Vim plugin installation method.
I like [vundle](http://github.com/gmarik/vundle), but other options like
[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) should work fine as well.
